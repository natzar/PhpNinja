# PhpNinja
Collection of deconstructions and studies about web development and website creation, made from the day to day work done at www.PhpNinja.info

What is a website? What actors take part? How websites are developed?
Our objective is to find optimals ways to develop something (or parts of something) that work inside a browser, across devices, user-cented always and not forgeting the current development status of the "something".


### Browser
Browser interprets HTML, include and evaluate JS files and include CSS rules to render it soon.

- Information exchange SERVER <> CLIENT (handshake)
- HTML CSS JS TEXT
- The DOM
- Desktop x Mobile Devices x Tablets x Browsers x Versions
- Responsive


### Design / Content
- Content Scanning, heat maps
- Elements: Position & Size
- Hierarchiy & Taxonomy: Information architecture

### The experience (from the users)
- Accesibility
- Goal: Complete tasks, get information, get entertained.
- web 1.0, web 2.0
- Localization: USD/Spanish/America [CURRENCY | LANGUAGE | GEO LOCATION]

### Writing META HTML - 
- Head
- Metas


### Writing HTML - Structure content
- From Server side
- From Javascript
- Hardcode
- HTML can exist without CSS and JS. Needs a browser to run.

### Writing CSS - Showing information with style
- Clases / Ids.
- Frameworks
- Hardcode
- Mobile First
- Needs HTML to run

### Writing Javascript - UI Interactions and cool effects
- Frameworks
- asyn / sync
- jquery 
- ESx Javascript syntax
- AJAX: based on a feature that was ignored for long
- Needs HTML to run(?)

### Development Cycle
- Builds
- Git
- Jenkins
- Automatic Tests

### Quality Assurance
- UI interactions
- Responsive ?
- Errors in Console. Not monitored real time.
- Errors in UI or CSS. "Need the human to review".

### Statuses / Sync
- Simulate Persistency: Local Storage + Server backend + real time data
- Paradigm: API <> Front (newer).
- Paradigm: All server side rendered (old) WordPress*.

### Security
- Forms / Urls

### DATA 
- External source
- internal source 
- Formats: JSON / XML / ...
- Fixtures

### Strategies 
- Cut the mustard 
- Progressive Enhacement
- Degrade to desktop
